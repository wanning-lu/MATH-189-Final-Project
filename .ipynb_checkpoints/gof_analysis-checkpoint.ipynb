However, the test suggests that there is strong evidence that the observed distribution of admissions by race does not match the expected distribution based on the application proportion, and we also find this phenomenon in tests on gender over most of the years, especially in recent years. Hence, if GPA of the students in each categories considered similar, the UC system should work on the admission differences by these factors."
